  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS USB driver (USBH-HID) 
  
  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The Human Interface Devices host driver implements the USB host controller as
  per the USB HID class specified by the USB-IF. This driver enables easy
  detection and data transfers with the attached USB HID devices.
  The HID Class is used for low bandwidth data exchange.

  This driver implements the HID class using USB Interrupt Transfer. One
  Control and one BULK IN endpoints are used to implement HID class. This driver
  uses the USBH driver interface functions to implement the USB HID host.
  
  ==============================================================================
  Hardware Flow Dependencies
  ==============================================================================
  The configuration of USB Device mode features of the MSS USB is covered by 
  this software stack. There are no dependencies on the hardware flow when 
  configuring the PolarFire SoC MSS USB.
  The base address and register addresses are defined in this driver as
  constants. The interrupt number assignment for the MSS USB peripherals are
  defined as constants in the MPFS HAL. You must ensure that the latest MPFS HAL
  is included in the project settings of the SoftConsole tool chain and that it
  is generated into your project.
  
  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The following steps are involved in the operation of USBH-HID driver:
        - Configuration
        - Initialization
        - Application call-back interface
        - Class Specific requests
        - Data transfer
  
  --------------------------------
  Configuration
  --------------------------------
  The MSS USB driver must first be configured in the USB Host mode using the
  MSS_USB_HOST_MODE to use this driver. No other configuration is necessary.

  --------------------------------
  Initialization
  --------------------------------
  The HID class driver must be initialized using the MSS_USBH_HID_init() function.
  A pointer to the structure of type mss_usbh_hid_user_cb_t must be provided as
  parameter with this function. This pointer is used to call the application
  call-back functions by the USBH-HID driver. These call-back functions can be
  used by the application to provide error/status messages to the user or for
  performing application specific handling of the events.

  --------------------------------
  Application call-back interface
  --------------------------------
  Application call-back interface
  After the USBH-Class driver is assigned to the attached device by the USBH
  driver, as indicated by usbh_class_allocate call-back, this driver can take
  over the communication with the attached device. This driver will then extend
  the enumeration process by requesting the class specific information from the
  device. During this process it will also call the call-back functions to
  indicate the progress of the enumeration process. These call-back functions
  must be implemented by application. These call-back functions can be used to
  take application specific action on specific event or can be used to provide
  error/status messages to the user. A type mss_usbh_hid_user_cb_t is provided
  by this driver which has all these call-back functions as its elements.
  Implementing these call-back functions is optional.

  --------------------------------
  Data transfer
  --------------------------------
  All data is exchanged between the host and the device in the form of reports.
  The format of the report is defined by the report descriptor defined by the 
  device based on device need. USB HOST will request the report descriptor 
  using interrupt transfers. Every HID device needs to have one input report 
  in its report descriptor. An interrupt IN endpoint is required for reading 
  reports from USB device. The interrupt OUT endpoint is optional.
  The HID class uses Interrupt Transfer mode, a maximum of 64 bytes can be 
  transferred in a single frame (i.e., 64 Kbyte/s per endpoint when operating 
  in Full-Speed mode).The USB Host driver needs to make sure that the data is 
  polled periodically.

  This driver only needs to perform the USB IN transfers on the Interrupt
  endpoint. The period at which this transfer is repeated is defined by the
  device endpoint descriptor during the enumeration process. The application
  must call the USBH_HID_Handle() function periodically to read the report from
  the HID device. The application must register the call back function which
  will be called by the USBH driver when the report is received.

  The mss_usbh_HID_err_code_t provides a type to identify the error occurred
  during retrieving configuration and other class specific descriptors from the
  attached HID class device. This type can be used with hidh_error  call-back
  function element of mss_usbh_hid_user_cb_t type to identify the exact cause
  of the error. The meaning of the constants is as described below

  |                               | consistent with the HID class.               |

  |                               | able to clear the stall condition on the     |
  |                               | attached device even after multiple retries. |

  application must define and initialize a structure of this type and provide
  the address of that structure as parameter to the MSS_USBH_HID_init() function.

  hidh_valid_config
  The function pointed by the hidh_valid_config function pointer will be called
  to indicate that a valid HID class configuration was found on the attached
  device and the device is configured for this configuration.

  hidh_tdev_ready
  The function pointed by the hidh_tdev_ready function pointer is called when
  this driver is able to retrieve all the HID class specific information
  (including sector size and sector number) from the attached device and is
  ready to perform the data transfers.

  hidh_driver_released
  The function pointed by the hidh_driver_released function pointer is called to
  indicate to the application that this driver is released by the USBH driver.
  This could be either because the HID class device is now detached or there is
  permanent error with the USBH driver.

  hidh_error
  The function pointed by the hidh_error function pointer is called to indicate
  that there was an error while retrieving the class specific descriptor
  information from the attached HID class device. The error_code parameter
  indicates the exact cause of the error.
  
  hidh_decode
  The function pointed by the hidh_decode function pointer is called to indicate
  that there is a new report received from the attached HID class device. The 
  data parameter indicates the location of received data present in the internal
  buffer.

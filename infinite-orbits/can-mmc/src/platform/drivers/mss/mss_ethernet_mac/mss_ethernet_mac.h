  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS Ethernet MAC Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
    The PolarFire SoC Microcontroller Subsystem (MSS) includes two Gigabit
    Ethernet MAC (GEM) hardware peripherals which support communications at
    10/100/1000 Mbps.

    This software driver provides a set of functions for controlling the MSS
    Ethernet MAC as part of a bare metal system where no operating system is
    available. The drivers can be adapted for use as part of an operating
    system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer between the driver
    and the operating system's driver model is outside the scope of the driver.

    Each GEM consists of two Ethernet MAC devices, the pMAC (pre-emptable MAC)
    and the eMAC (express MAC) which share a single network port. The MMSL 
    (Media Merge Sub Layer) is responsible for multiplexing the network port 
    between the two MACs. When IEEE 802.3br Frame pre-emption is enabled, the
    transmission of packets via the pMAC can be interrupted by packets 
    transmitted via the eMAC. This can result in pMAC packets being split into
    two or more segments. __Note:__ For this feature to work, both link partners
    must support IEEE 802.3br Frame pre-emption.
    
    The GEMs support GMII/MII and SGMII connections to an external Ethernet PHY
    device and the device driver can configure the devices at run time to select
    which interface is active.

    The driver implements a sub-driver interface for configuring and controlling
    the PHY and example drivers for a number of different PHYs are provided with
    the driver.
    
    In addition to the standard Ethernet features, the GEMs support a number of
    advanced features including:
        - IEEE 1588 Time stamping support for PTPv1 and PTPv2.
        - IEEE 802.1Qci Receive traffic policing.
        - IEEE 802.1Qbb Priority based flow control.
        - IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging.
        - IEEE 802.1Qav Credit based traffic shaping.
        - IEEE 802.1Qaz Bandwidth based transmit queueing.
        - IEEE 802.1Qbv Time based priority queueing.
        - IEEE 802.1CB Frame Redundancy and Elimination.
        - IEEE 802.1AS Time stamping.
        - IEEE 802.3br Frame pre-emption.
        - TCP/UDP/IP Checksum offload.
        - TCP/IP Large Send Offload.
        - Advanced DMA system to provide high performance operation.

    The driver provides basic support for some of these features but more 
    advanced use of the features will require application level support and/or
    modifications to the driver.

    __Note:__ In terms of the standard Ethernet support, this driver is modeled
    on the MSS MAC Ethernet device drivers from previous generations of
    Microchip FPGA SoC devices to facilitate porting of designs to the MPFS
    platform. However unlike the previous MSS Ethernet MACs, the PolarFire SoC
    MSS supports up to 4 MACs. Each GEM device has 1 x pMAC and 1 x eMAC, and so
    most driver functions now have a parameter which identifies the specific GEM
    device and MAC that the function should act upon. In addition, the pMACs 
    support multiple queues and so some functions require a queue identifier as
    well.

  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
    The configuration of all features of the MSS Ethernet MAC is covered by this
    driver with the exception of the PolarFire SoC IOMUX configuration.
    PolarFire SoC allows multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins
    through IOMUX configuration. This feature allows optimization of external
    pin usage by assigning external pins for use by either the microprocessor
    subsystem or the FPGA fabric. The MDIO signals are routed through IOMUXs to
    the PolarFire SoC device external pins. The MDIO signals may also be routed
    through IOMUXs to the PolarFire SoC FPGA fabric. The IOMUXs are configured
    using the PolarFire SoC MSS configurator tool. You must ensure that the MSS
    Ethernet MAC are enabled and configured in the PolarFire SoC MSS
    configurator if you wish to use them. For more information on IOMUX, refer
    to the I/O Configuration section of the PolarFire SoC Microprocessor
    Subsystem (MSS) User's Guide.

    The base address, register addresses and interrupt number assignment for the
    MSS Ethernet MAC are defined as constants in the PolarFire SoC HAL. You must
    ensure that the latest PolarFire SoC HAL is included in the project settings
    of the software tool chain used to build your project and that it is
    generated into your project.

    The MSS Ethernet MAC supports the following selections for the PHY
    interface:

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver functions are grouped into the following
    categories:
        - __Initialization and configuration__
        - __Transmit operations__
        - __Receive operations__
        - __Reading link status and statistics__
        - __Feature support__
        
    @subsection init Initialization and Configuration
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver is initialized and configured by
    calling the _MSS_MAC_init()_ function. The _MSS_MAC_init()_ function takes
    as one of its parameters a pointer to a configuration data structure. This
    data structure contains all the configuration information required to
    initialize and configure the Ethernet MAC.
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver provides the _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_
    function to initialize the configuration data structure entries to default
    values. It is recommended to use this function to retrieve the default
    configuration and then overwrite the defaults with the application specific
    settings such as PHY address, PHY type, interface type, allowed link speeds,
    link duplex mode and MAC address etc.
    
    The following functions are used as part of the initialization and
    configuration process:
        - _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_
        - _MSS_MAC_init()_
        
    @subsection tx_ops Transmit Operations
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver transmit operations are interrupt driven. The
    application must register a transmit call-back function with the driver
    using the _MSS_MAC_set_tx_callback()_ function. This call-back function will
    be called by the MSS Ethernet MAC driver every time a packet has been sent.
    The application must call the _MSS_MAC_send_pkt()_ function every time it
    wants to transmit a packet. The application must pass a pointer to the
    buffer containing the packet to send. It is the application's responsibility
    to manage the memory allocated to store the transmit packets. The MSS
    Ethernet MAC driver only requires a pointer to the instance structure for
    the desired MAC, a pointer to the buffer containing the packet, the queue
    number and the packet size. The MSS Ethernet MAC driver will call the
    transmit call-back function registered using the _MSS_MAC_set_tx_callback()_
    function once a packet is sent. The transmit call-back function is supplied
    by the application and can be used to, for example, release the memory used
    to store the packet that was sent.
    
    The following functions are used as part of the transmit operations:
        - _MSS_MAC_send_pkt()_
        - _MSS_MAC_send_pkts()_
        - _MSS_MAC_set_tx_callback()_
        
    @subsection rx_ops Receive Operations
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver receive operations are interrupt driven. The
    application must first register a receive call-back function using the
    _MSS_MAC_set_rx_callback()_ function. The application can then allocate
    receive buffers to the MSS Ethernet MAC driver by calling the
    _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function. This function can be called multiple times
    to allocate more than one receive buffer. The MSS Ethernet MAC driver will
    then call the receive call-back whenever a packet is received into one of
    the receive buffers. It will hand back the receive buffer to the application
    for packet processing. This buffer will not be reused by the MSS Ethernet
    MAC driver unless it is re-allocated to the driver by a call to
    _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_.
    
    The following functions are used as part of the receive operations:
        - _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_
        - _MSS_MAC_set_rx_callback()_
        
    @subsection stats Reading Status and Statistics
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver provides the following functions to retrieve the
    current link status and statistics.
        - _MSS_MAC_get_link_status()_
        - _MSS_MAC_read_stat()_

    @subsection features Feature Support
    The MSS Ethernet MAC driver provides the following functions to support on
    the fly configuration and control of various features of the MSS
    Ethernet MAC devices.
        - _MSS_MAC_read_TSU()_
        - _MSS_MAC_init_TSU()_
        - _MSS_MAC_set_TSU_rx_mode()_
        - _MSS_MAC_set_TSU_tx_mode()_

    This parameter is a pointer to the list of packets to send. The list
    consists of a sequence of _mss_mac_tx_pkt_info_t_ structures with the last
    entry having a length field of 0.

  @return
    This function returns the following values:

     - ___MSS_MAC_ERR_OK___ on successfully launching the packet.
     - ___MSS_MAC_ERR_NOT_DONE___ if the previous packet has not finished
          sending.
     - ___MSS_MAC_ERR_NOT_OK___ for general errors.
     - ___MSS_MAC_ERR_TX_TIMEOUT___ If the previous packet has not released the
          queue buffers after the MAC completes the send.
     - ___MSS_MAC_ERR_TX_FAIL___ If the previous packet has not released the
          queue buffers after the MAC completes the send and there is an error
          flagged in the tx descriptor.

  Example:
  This example demonstrates the use of the _MSS_MAC_send_pkts()_ function. The
  application builds a list of 10 arp packets over multiple queues and then
  calls _MSS_MAC_send_pkts()_ to transmit them in one go.

/***************************************************************************//**
  The _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function assigns a buffer to one of  the Ethernet
  MAC's receive descriptors. The receive buffer specified as parameter will be
  used to receive one single packet. The receive buffer will be handed back to
  the application via a call to the receive callback function assigned through a
  call to _MSS_MAC_set_rx_callback()_. The _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function will
  need to be called again pointing to the same buffer if more packets are to be
  received into this same buffer after the packet has been processed by the
  application.
  
  The _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function is non-blocking. It will return
  immediately and does not wait for a packet to be received. The application 
  needs to implement a receive callback function to be notified that a packet
  has been received.
  
  The _p_user_data_ parameter can be optionally used to point to a memory
  management data structure managed by the application.
 
  @param this_mac
    This parameter is a pointer to one of the global _mss_mac_instance_t_
    structures which identifies the MAC that the function is to operate on.
    There are between 1 and 4 such structures identifying pMAC0, eMAC0, pMAC1
    and eMAC1.

  @param queue_no
    This parameter identifies the queue to which this transmit operation
    applies. For single queue devices this should be set to 0 for compatibility
    purposes.

  @param rx_pkt_buffer
    This parameter is a pointer to a memory buffer. It points to the memory that
    will be assigned to one of the Ethernet MAC's receive descriptors. It must
    point to a buffer large enough to contain the largest possible packet.
  
  @param p_user_data
    This parameter is intended to help the application manage memory. Its usage
    is left to the application. The Ethernet MAC driver does not make use of
    this pointer. The Ethernet MAC driver will pass this pointer back to the
    application as part of the call to the application's receive callback
    function to help the application associate the received packet with the
    memory it allocated prior to the call to _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_.
 
  @param enable
    This parameter controls the enabling of the Ethernet MAC interrupt. If set
    to _MSS_MAC_INT_DISABLE_, the interrupt is left disabled by this function.
    If set to _MSS_MAC_INT_ENABLE_, the interrupt is enabled on return from this
    function. This allows a series of packet buffers to be assigned without
    there being any modifications to the internal packet buffer tables. To
    achieve this, enable should be _MSS_MAC_INT_DISABLE_ for all but the last
    call to the function. When allocating a chain of buffers, the last call to
    _MSS_MAC_send_pkt()_ should use a value of _MSS_MAC_INT_ARM_ to set up the
    RX interrupt for the first time.

  @return
    This function returns 1 on successfully assigning the buffer to a receive
    descriptor. It returns 0 otherwise.
  
  Example:
  The example below demonstrates the use of the _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function
  to handle packet reception using two receive buffers. The _init()_ function
  calls the _MSS_MAC_set_rx_callback()_ function to register the _rx_callback()_
  receive callback function with the Ethernet MAC driver. The
  _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ function is then called twice to assign _rx_buffer_1_
  and _rx_buffer_2_ to Ethernet MAC descriptors for packet reception. The 
  _rx_callback_ function will be called by the Ethernet MAC driver once a packet
  has been received into one of the receive buffers. The _rx_callback()_
  function calls the _process_rx_packet()_ application function to process the
  received packet then calls _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ to reallocate the receive
  buffer to receive another packet. The _rx_callback()_ function will be called
  again every time a packet is received to process the received packet and
  reallocate _rx_buffer_ for packet reception.
  
  __Note:__ The use of the _p_user_data parameter_ to handle the buffer
  reassignment to the Ethernet MAC as part of the _rx_callback()_ function. This
  is a simplistic use of _p_user_data_. It is more likely that _p_user_data_
  would be useful to keep track of a pointer to a TCP/IP stack packet container
  data structure dynamically allocated. In this more complex use case, the first
  parameter of _MSS_MAC_receive_pkt()_ would point to the actual receive buffer
  and the second parameter would point to a data structure used to free the
  receive buffer memory once the packet has been consumed by the TCP/IP stack.

/***************************************************************************//**
  The _MSS_MAC_get_type_2_filter()_ function is used to retrieve the current
  Type 2 filter configuration from the Ethernet MAC. These filters allow
  selective routing of packets to specific queues based on combinations of
  Ethertype field values, general data patterns and VLAN priority values.
  Packets can also be flagged for dropping based on the same criteria.

  Packets that do not match a Type 1 or Type 2 filter are automatically routed
  to queue 0.

  @param this_mac
    This parameter is a pointer to one of the global _mss_mac_instance_t_
    structures which identifies the MAC that the function is to operate on.
    There are between 1 and 4 such structures identifying pMAC0, eMAC0, pMAC1
    and eMAC1.

  @param filter_no
    This parameter of type _uint32_t_, selects which filter to retrieve. The
    valid range is 0 to 3 for pMACs and 0 to 1 for eMACs.

  @param filter
    This parameter of type pointer to _mss_mac_type_2_filter_t_, points to the

  PolarFire SoC MSS Ethernet MAC Configuration Structure.
  
  The _mss_mac_cfg_t_ type contains the initial configuration values for the
  MPFS Ethernet MAC. You need to create a record of this type to hold the
  configuration of the MAC. _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ is used to 
  initialize the configuration record to default values. Later, the
  configuration elements in the record can be changed to desired values before
  passing them to _MSS_MAC_init()_.

  __Note:__ Even though most of these values are small, we use _uint32_t_ for
  most values here as they will be used in calculations that are based on
  _uint32_t_ values and this avoids having to put casts everywhere...

  ___interface_type___:
    This indicates the type of interface between the MAC and the PHY. The
    currently supported values are:
  
      - _NULL_PHY_   – No PHY involved, usually for direct connection via the
                       fabric.
      - _GMII_       – Connection via GMII routed through the fabric to external
                       PHY device.
      - _TBI_        – Connection via SGMII block to external PHY device.
      - _GMII_SGMII_ – Emulation platform specific option using SGMII to GMII
                       bridge.

  ___phy_type___:
    This indicates the type of PHY device connected to the MAC. The currently
    supported values are:

      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_NULL_         – No PHY device.
      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_VSC8575_      – VSC8575 with full VTSS API.
      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_VSC8575_LITE_ – VSC8757 with Lite VTSS API.
      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_VSC8541_      – VSC8541 without VTSS API.
      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_VSC8662_      – VSC88662 without VTSS API.
      - _MSS_MAC_DEV_PHY_DP83867_      – TI DP83867.

  ___phy_autonegotiate_mac___  
  ___phy_get_link_status___  
  ___phy_extended_read___  
  ___phy_init_extended_write___:  
    These are callback functions for the PHY support within the driver. These
    should be set to the appropriate PHY driver functions for the attached PHY
    device. See _mss_mac_phy_init_t_, _mss_mac_phy_set_speed_t_,
    _mss_mac_phy_autonegotiate_t_, _mss_mac_phy_get_link_status_t_,
    _mss_mac_phy_extended_read_t_ and _mss_mac_phy_extended_write_t_ for
    details.

  ___queue_enable___:
    This array of values of length _MSS_MAC_QUEUE_COUNT_, indicates which queues
    are to be enabled. 0 in an entry indicates disabled and 1 indicates enabled.

  ___speed_mode___:
    This parameter specifies the mode of operation for the Ethernet interface.
    The following values are supported:

      - _MSS_MAC_SPEED_AN_

      - _MSS_MAC_10_FDX_
      - _MSS_MAC_100_HDX_
      - _MSS_MAC_100_FDX_
      - _MSS_MAC_1000_HDX_
      - _MSS_MAC_1000_FDX_

    If _MSS_MAC_SPEED_AN_ is selected then the _speed_duplex_select_ 
    configuration parameter indicates the allowed speed combinations. For all
    other modes, the link autonegotiation is disabled.

  ___speed_duplex_select___:
    This configuration parameter specifies the allowed link speeds when
    autonegotiation is enabled. It is a bit-mask of the various link speed and
    duplex modes. The speed_duplex_select configuration can be set to a bitmask
    of the following defines to specify the allowed link speed and duplex mode:

      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_10M_FD_
      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_10M_HD_
      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_100M_FD_
      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_100M_HD_
      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_1000M_FD_
      - _MSS_MAC_ANEG_1000M_HD_

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration
    parameter to _MSS_MAC_ANEG_ALL_SPEEDS_ indicating that a link will be setup
    for best available speed and duplex combination.

  ___mac_addr___:
    This configuration parameter is a 6-byte array containing the local MAC
    address of the Ethernet MAC. For correct operation, this value should be
    unique for each of the 4 MAC elements within the MSS and if more than one
    system containing an MPFS device is present on a LAN then the MAC addresses
    must all be unique. Tha management and allocation of the MAC addresses is
    left up to the user.

  ___phy_address___:
    This parameter specifies the address of the PHY device, usually set in
    hardware by the address pins of the PHY device.

  ___pcs_phy_address___:
    This parameter specifies the address of the control device for hidden SGMII
    type interfaces such as that in the G5 SoC emulation platform.

  ___phy_soft_reset_gpio___:
    Identifies the MSS GPIO device that the PHY soft reset pin is connected to.
    A Value of _NULL_ indicates the soft reset signal is not available for 
    control via an MSS GPIO pin.

  ___phy_soft_reset_pin___:
    Identifies the MSS GPIO pin that the PHY soft reset pin is connected to.

  ___phy_hard_reset_gpio___:
    Identifies the MSS GPIO device that the PHY hard reset pin is connected to.

    Pointer to the MAC instance structure to which the PHY is connected. This
    supports the use of multi-port PHY devices which may be connected to a
    single MAC device or configurations where only a single MDIO interface is
    exposed to the outside world. If _NULL_, the current MAC device is used.

    In configurations that use this feature, it is important that the MAC device
    that the PHY is connected to is initialized first.

  ___tx_edc_enable___:
    This parameter specifies enable or disable error detection and correction
    for tx FIFOs. The allowed values for the tx_edc_enable configuration
    parameter are:

    length to be transmitted and received. When disabled, the MAC limits the
    length of frames at the maximum frame length. The allowed values for the
    _jumbo_frame_enable_ configuration parameter are:

      - _MSS_MAC_JUMBO_FRAME_ENABLE_
      - _MSS_MAC_JUMBO_FRAME_DISABLE_

    CRC. The allowed values for the _append_CRC_ parameter are:

      - _MSS_MAC_CRC_ENABLE_
      - _MSS_MAC_CRC_DISABLE_

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration
    parameter to _MSS_MAC_CRC_ENABLE_.

  ___fullduplex___:
    This specifies enable or disable full duplex. When enabled, the MAC operates
    in full duplex mode. When disabled, the MAC operates in half duplex mode.

  ___ipg_multiplier___  
  ___ipg_divisor___:  
    These parameters specify the minimum size of gap (IPG/IFG) to enforce
    between frames (expressed in bit times). They are both 8 bit values and are
    used to calculate an IPG value based on the last packet sent by multiplying
    the length by _ipg_multiplier_ and dividing the result by _ipg_divisor_. The
    resulting number of bits is used if it is greater than the default 96 bits.

    To select standard 96 bit IPG, set _ipg_multiplier_ to _MSS_MAC_IPG_DEFVAL_.

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration
    parameter to _MSS_MAC_IPG_DEFVAL_.

    parameter to _MSS_MAC_MAXFRAMELEN_DEFVAL_.

  ___use_hi_address___:
    When set to 0, _use_hi_address_ selects the default AXI slave slot 5 address
    for the location of the registers of the GEM device. When set to non 0, AXI
    slave slot 6 is used to access the device.

    parameter to 0.

  ___use_local_ints___:
    When set to 0, _use_local_ints_ selects the PLIC interrupts as the source
    for interrupts from the GEM. When set to non 0, local interrupts are used.
    GEM0 is connected to the local interrupts of U54 numbers 1 and 2. GEM1 is
    connected to the local interrupts of U54 numbers 3 and 4.

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration
    parameter to 0.

  ___queue0_int_priority___:  
  ___queue1_int_priority___:  
  ___queue2_int_priority___:  
  ___queue3_int_priority___:  
  ___mmsl_int_priority___:  
    These parameters indicate the interrupt priority to use for each of the
    interrupt sources that the GEM supports. A priority of 0 effectively
    disables an interrupt and a priority of 7 is the highest priority that can
    be assigned.

    _queue0_int_priority_ is the priority for the primary queue for the pMAC and
    the only queue for the eMAC.

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets these configuration
    parameters to 7.

  ___tsu_clock_select___:
    Selects the TSU clock source. 0 is the default TSU clock source and 1 is the
    alternative TSU clock source driven from the fabric.

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration
    parameter to 0.
    
  ___amba_burst_length___:
    Sets the burst length for the DMA AXI data access transfers. Valid values
    are:

    - 0x00 - Attempt to use bursts up to 256
    - 0x01 - Always use single bursts
    - 0x02 - Always use single bursts
    - 0x04 - Attempt to use bursts up to 4
    - 0x08 - Attempt to use bursts up to 8
    - 0x10 - Attempt to use bursts up to 16

    The _MSS_MAC_cfg_struct_def_init()_ function sets this configuration parameter
    to 0x10 for bursts up to 16.

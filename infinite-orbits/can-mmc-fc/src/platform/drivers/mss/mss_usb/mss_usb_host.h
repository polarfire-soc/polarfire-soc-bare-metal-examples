  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The USB Host Driver (USBH) is part of the USB-LL layer of the MSS USB driver
  stack. The USBH driver implements the core functionality of the USB host mode
  operations. The USBH driver is responsible for the following functionalities.
    - Device attach and detach handling
    - Enumeration and USB Standard requests
    - Device Suspend, Resume and Reset handling
    - USB transfers management
    - USBH-Class call-back interface
    - Application call-back interface

  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The following steps are involved in the operation of the USBH driver:
    - Configuration
    - Initialization
    - USBH-Class Interface
    - Application Interface
    - Data transfer

  The USBH driver operation depends on user configuration provided in
  mss_usb_config.h.

  --------------------------------
  Configuration
  --------------------------------
  The following parameter must be defined in the mss_usb_config.h file to
  operate the MSS USB hardware block in USB Host mode.

  MSS_USB_HOST_MODE   Configures the MSS USB Driver Stack to operate in USB
  host mode.

  --------------------------------
  Initialization
  --------------------------------
  The USBH driver must be initialized by calling the MSS_USBH_init()
  initialization function with a parameter to provide the application call-back
  interface. Once initialized the USBH driver is ready to detect the attach
  event on the USB port. The application call-back interface is used to provide
  information about the events on the USB bus to the application. The
  MSS_USBH_task() is the main task of the USBH driver which implements the state
  machines for monitoring the USB bus activities. This function must be called
  repeatedly by the application to allow USBH driver to run it's state machines.
  A timer/scheduler can be used to call this function at regular intervals or it
  can be called from the main continuous foreground loop of the application.
  The function MSS_USBH_1ms_tick() must be called to provide a 1milisecond time
  tick to the USBH driver. This time tick is used by the USBH driver to track
  the enumeration process and other housekeeping purposes. The
  MSS_USBH_get_milis() function is provided to get the number of milliseconds
  lapsed from the system reset. The MSS_USBH_test_mode() function is provided to
  force the MSS USB in test modes as required by the USB compliance test
  specification. This function has no use in normal operations with a attached
  USB device.

  --------------------------------
  USBH-Class Call-back Interface
  --------------------------------
  This driver encapsulates the generic USB protocol functionality from the USB
  class functionality. This driver needs the USBH-Class driver to implement a
  set of call-back functions to pass on the control to the USBH-Class driver for
  handling the USB class specific functionality. This driver provides a data
  type mss_usbh_class_cb_t which must be implemented by the USBH-Class driver.
  This data type is the collection of call-back functions which must be
  implemented by the USBH-Class driver. Implementing all the elements of this
  structure may not be necessary for a specific USB class. The USBH-Class driver
  must define a structure of type mss_usbh_class_cb_t and implement its required
  elements. The function MSS_USBH_register_class_driver() must be used to inform
  the USBH driver about this call-back interface and the supported USB Class
  information
  The table below lists the prototypes of the call-back functions which are part 
  of the mss_usbh_class_cb_t   type and the event in which they are called.
  
  | Call-back Element      | Event                                             |
  |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | usbh_class_allocate    | Called when a match is found between the class    |
  |                        | sub-class code and protocol code of the attached  |
  |                        | device and the corresponding parameters provided  |
  |                        | by the USBH-Class driver in the class_id parameter|
  | usbh_class_release     | Called when the device for which this USBH-Class  |
  |                        | driver is assigned is detached                    |
  | usbh_class_cep_xfr_done| Called when a transfer started by this USBH-Class |
  |                        | driver is complete                                |
  | usbh_class_tx_done     | Called when a transfer started on the OUT pipe by |
  |                        | this USBH-Class driver is complete                |
  | usbh_class_rx_done     | Called when a transfer started on the IN pipe by  |
  |                        | this USBH-Class driver is complete                |
  | usbh_class_sof         | The function pointed by the usbh_class_sof element|
  |                        | will be called when a new (micro) frame starts    |
  
  --------------------------------
  Application Call-back Interface
  --------------------------------
  The USBH driver uses interrupts to respond to the events on MSS USB. The
  USBH driver handles the enumeration of the attached device internally.
  The enumeration process can take long time (hundreds of milliseconds) to
  complete. The USBH driver uses application call-back interface to inform the
  application about the events on the USB bus as they happen. The application
  may implement these call-back functions to take application specific action
  on each event or to provide error/status messages to the user.
  
  The table below lists the prototypes of the call-back functions which are 
  part of the mss_usbh_user_cb_t type and the event in which they are called.
  
  | Element                         | Call-back Event                          |
  |---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | usbh_tdev_attached              | Called when a device-attach event is     |
  |                                 | detected by the USBH driver. At this     |
  |                                 | point the device is not enumerated.      |
  | usbh_tdev_dettached             | Called when a device-detach event is     |
  |                                 | detected by the USBH driver              |

  | usbh_tdev_enumerated            | Called when the attached device is       |
  |                                 | successfully enumerated                  |
  | usbh_tdev_class_driver_assigned | Called when a matching class driver is   |
  |                                 | assigned to the attached device          |
  | usbh_tdev_not_supported         | Called when a device which is not        |
  |                                 | supported by the USBH driver is detected |
  | usbh_tdev_permanent_error       | Called if there was error during data    |
  |                                 | transfer operations with the attached    |
  |                                 | device                                   |
  
  --------------------------------
  Data transfer
  --------------------------------
  The USB host uses pipe, a representation of logical connection from endpoint
  on MSS USB to the endpoint on the target device. The transmit pipe or the
  receive pipe must first be configured before starting the data transfer on it.
  The functions MSS_USBH_configure_in_pipe() and MSS_USBH_configure_out_pipe()
  must be used to configure an IN(data moving from device to host) and an
  OUT(data moving from host to device) pipe respectively.

  The application must use MSS_USBH_write_out_pipe() function to start data
  transmission on a OUT pipe. This function prepares the MSS USB to transmit
  data to the device. However, actual transmission happens depending on the
  transfer type and the selected interval. This function is non-blocking.
  The USBH-Class driver will be informed about data transmission completion or
  transmission errors by a call to its call-back function. Please refer
  USBH-Class Interface section above for more details.

  To receive data from attached USB device, application must use
  MSS_USBH_read_in_pipe() function. This function prepares the MSS USB to
  receive data from the attached device. However, actual data transfer happens
  depending on the transfer type and the selected interval. This function is
  non-blocking. On receiving data or in case of errors during this operation
  the USBH-Class driver will be informed about it by calling a call-back 
  function. Please refer the USBH-Class Interface section above for more
  details.

  This driver supports multi-packet Bulk transfer (both IN and OUT), to make 
  sure that it is able to use the full bandwidth offered by USB Bulk transfers.
  When a transfer size of more than wMaxPktSize is provided to this driver using
  MSS_USBH_write_out_pipe() function or MSS_USBH_read_in_pipe() function, this
  driver handles this multi-packet transfer internally by dividing it into
  multiple Bulk transfers of wMaxPktSize each. This way no application
  intervention is required till the total multi-packet Bulk transfer is
  complete.

  The USBH driver supports Bulk transfers using the DMA inside MSS USB or
  without using the internal DMA. It is advised that the USBH driver is
  configured to use the internal DMA in order to free up the application from
  transferring data to/from MSS USB hardware block. However, the internal DMA
  can access only aligned address. Care must be taken that the buffer address
  provided to the USBH driver must be modulo-4. This is not a requirement when
  the MSS USB driver is configured not to use internal DMA.

  All the control transfers happen on the control pipe. The control pipe is
  shared by the USBH driver and the USBH-Class driver. When the USBH-Class
  driver needs to perform control transfer on the attached device, it must first
  configure the control pipe using the MSS_USBH_configure_control_pipe()
  function. The MSS_USBH_start_control_xfr() function can be used to start the
  control transfer After the control pope is configured. The data direction is
  determined by a parameter provided with this function. The USBH-Class driver
  will be informed about the data transfer completion or the error status by
  calling a call-back function. Please refer the USBH-Class Interface section
  above for more details. The control transfer can be started by a USBH-Class
  driver only when the control pipe is free.The MSS_USBH_get_cep_state()
  function can be used to know the current state of the control pipe. At the
  start of the control transfer the USBH driver must send a setup-packet to the
  attached device in the setup phase. The function
  MSS_USBH_construct_get_descr_command() can be used to construct the setup
  packet as per the USB specification for the transfer to be performed. This
  function formats the setup packet depending on the parameters provided with
  this function.

  The application may choose to keep the MSS USB in suspend state to conserve
  power to the USB device, and the MSS USB, In this state the MSS USB does not
  send any frames on the bus and there will be no bus activity. This will also
  ensure that the attached device enters suspend state as specified in the
  USB2.0 specification. The USBH driver provides the MSS_USBH_suspend() function
  to suspend the MSS USB. The  MSS_USBH_resume() function must be used to
  resume the normal operations.
  
  The table below provides the list of all the functions provided by USBH
  driver.

    must be a multiple of 8. If the value provided is not a multiple of 8, then 
    the immediate lower value which is a multiple of 8 is taken as the FIFO 
    address.
    E.g. If the provided value is 0x09, the actual value taken by the driver is
    0x08. If the provided value is less than 0x08 then the FIFO address is taken
    as 0x00.

  @param fifo_size
    The fifo_size parameter provides the endpoint FIFO size in the USB core
    internal RAM. The valid FIFO size values are 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024,
    2048, 4096. The MSS USB assigns 8 byte FIFO by default if the FIFO size is
    not configured.

  @param max_pkt_size
    The max_pkt_size parameter provides the maximum packet size of the USB
    transfer. This value must be equal to the maximum packet size as mentioned
    in the endpoint descriptor which is used during enumeration process.

    Note: This value must be less than or equal to the FIFO size value.


  @param num_usb_pkt
    The num_usb_pkt parameter has different meanings for different types of
    transfers.

    Low bandwidth ISO/interrupt transfers - This parameter must always be 1u.
    This parameter represents the number of packets transferred in one (micro) 
    frame.

    High bandwidth ISO transfers - This parameter represents the number of
    packets transferred in one (Micro) frame. In this case, this parameter can
    have a value of 1 2 or 3. High bandwidth ISO transfers are not yet
    implemented.

    Bulk transfers. - For Bulk transfer this value must always be 1u. This
    parameter is  be used with the auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature where it
    indicates number of bulk packets to be auto-amalgamated/auto-split in bulk
    transfer. The auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature is implemented but not
    yet tested.

  @param dma_enable
    The dma_enable parameter specifies whether or not the internal DMA must be
    used for the data transfer from the provided buffer to the USB FIFO.

  @param dma_channel
    The dma_channel parameter specifies the internal DMA channel to be used for
    the data transfers. DMA channel will be associated with selected endpoint.
    A unique DMA channel must be selected to transfer data on individual
    endpoints. This parameter is ignored when dma_enable parameter indicates
    that the DMA must not be used.

  @param xfr_type
    The xfr_type parameter specifies the type of transfer to be performed on the
    specified endpoint. All other types of transfers (Interrupt, Isochronous,
    and Bulk) can be selected except the control transfer.

  @param add_zlp
    The add_zlp parameter indicates whether to expect a zero length packet (ZLP)
    if the transfer size is exact a multiple of wMaxPacketSize. This parameter
    is only applicable for bulk transfers. For all other transfer types this
    parameter is ignored.

  @param interval
    The interval parameter for interrupt and isochronous transfers defines the
    polling interval for the currently-selected IN pipe. For bulk transfers,
    this parameter indicates the number of frames/microframes after which the IN
    pipe must timeout on receiving a stream of NAK responses. The valid values
    for this parameter are as mentioned in the table below.

    | Transfer Type    |  Speed     | Valid values                             |
    |------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|

    |  Isochronous     | FS or HS   | 1,2,4,8,16,32,64…32768 frames/microframes|
    |                  |            |                                          |
    |  Bulk            |    HS      | 0,2,4,8,16,32,64…32768 microframes       |
    |                  |            | Note:Value 0 disables the NAK Timeout    |
    |                  |            | detection on Bulk endpoint               |

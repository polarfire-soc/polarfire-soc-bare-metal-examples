  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The Mass Storage Class host driver implements the USB host controller as per
  the USB MSC class specified by the USB-IF. This driver enables easy detection
  and data transfers with the attached USB mass storage devices.

  This driver implements the MSC class using Bulk Only transport (BOT). One
  BULK IN and one BULK OUT endpoints are used to implement BOT. This MSC class
  host supports one LUN.

  This driver uses the USBH driver interface functions to implement the USB MSC
  host. This host controller will be able to work with all the USB flash drives
  which fall in "Memory stick" category.

  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The following steps are involved in the operation of USBH-MSC driver:
    - Configuration
    - Initialization
    - Enumeration
    - Class Specific requests
    - Data transfer

  --------------------------------
  Configuration
  --------------------------------
  The MSS USB driver must first be configured in the USB Host mode using the
  MSS_USB_HOST_MODE to use this driver. No other configuration is necessary.

  --------------------------------
  Initialization
  --------------------------------
  The MSC class driver must be initialized using the MSS_USBH_MSC_init() function.
  A pointer to the structure of type mss_usbh_msc_user_cb_t must be provided as
  parameter with this function. This pointer is used to call the application
  call-back functions by the USBH-MSC driver. These call-back functions can be
  used by the application to provide error/status messages to the user or for
  performing application specific handling of the events.

  --------------------------------
  Class Specific requests
  --------------------------------
  The class specific requests are handled internally by this driver. Both the
  GET_MAX_LUN and the RESET_RECOVERY requests are supported. The GET_MAX_LUN
  request is executed after the enumeration process to find out the number of
  LUNs on the attached device. This driver supports one LUN (index 0).

  --------------------------------
  Application call-back interface
  --------------------------------
  After the USBH-Class driver is assigned to the attached device by the USBH
  driver, as indicated by usbh_class_allocate call-back, this driver can take
  over the communication with the attached device. This driver will then extend
  the enumeration process by requesting the class specific information from the
  device. During this process it will also call the call-back functions to
  indicate the progress of the enumeration process. These call-back functions
  must be implemented by application. These call-back functions can be used to
  take application specific action on specific event or can be used to provide
  error/status messages to the user. A type mss_usbh_msc_user_cb_t is provided
  by this driver which has all these call-back functions as its elements.
  Implementing these call-back functions is optional.

  |                                        | size and sector number) from the  |

  |                                        | released by the USBH driver       |
  |                                        |                                   |
  | void (*msch_error)(int8_t error_code)  | Called to indicate that there was |

  |                                        | class specific descriptor         |
  |                                        | information from the attached MSC |
  |                                        | class device.                     |

  --------------------------------
  Data transfer
  --------------------------------
  The MSC class driver performs the data transfers using one BULK IN endpoint
  and one BULK OUT endpoint. The data transfers use transparent SCSI commands
  and follow the BoT specification. The BoT read/write operations happen on
  logical units of fixed block size. During initialization this driver takes
  care of finding all information about the attached device. The
  MSS_USBH_MSC_get_sector_count() and MSS_USBH_MSC_get_sector_size() functions
  can be used to find out the sector count and the sector size on the attached
  MSC class device.

  Most of the times the read (READ_10) and write (WRITE_10) are the only SCSI
  operations that the application needs to do. The MSS_USBH_MSC_read() and
  MSS_USBH_MSC_write() functions are provided for this purpose. The application
  can use the MSS_USBH_MSC_scsi_req() function if it needs to perform any other
  SCSI operation. This function can be used for READ_10 and WRITE_10 commands as
  well. Once the SCSI request is initiated using any of the above functions,
  the MSS_USBH_MSC_is_scsi_req_complete() function can be used to find out when
  the operation is complete.

  The USBH driver supports multi-packet Bulk transfers. The USBH-MSC driver makes
  full use of this feature by passing on the multi-sector transfers from the
  application to the USBH driver. To free up the application from transferring
  data to/from MSS USB FIFO, this driver can configure USBH driver to use the
  MSS USB internal DMA.

  The MSS_USBH_MSC_construct_cbw_cb10byte() and MSS_USBH_MSC_construct_cbw_cb6byte()
  functions are provided so that the user can easily prepare the CBW format
  buffer by providing appropriate parameters instead of manually creating the
  CBW command buffer.

  the LUN to which this command block is addressed. Otherwise, the host shall
  set this field to zero.

  The MSS_USBH_MSC_read() function can be used to read data from the attached
  mass storage device. This is a non-blocking function. The function prepares
  the MSS USB for the USB IN transfer. Once prepared, the MSS USB will start
  this IN transfer depending on the configuration of the IN pipe on which this
  transfer is occurring. The USBH-MSC driver takes care of the allocation and
  configuration of the IN pipe during enumeration process depending on the
  attached mass storage device. After preparing the IN pipe for the IN transfer,
  the MSS_USBH_MSC_is_scsi_req_complete() function can be used to find out the
  completion of the transfer.

  @param buf
    The buf parameter is a pointer to the buffer where the data received in the
    IN transfer from the attached MSC class device is stored.

  @param sector
    The sector parameter indicates the sector number (logical block address) on
    the mass storage device starting from which the data is to be read.

    The count parameter indicates the number of sectors to be read.

  The MSS_USBH_MSC_write() function can be used to write data to the attached
  mass storage device. This is a non-blocking function. The function readies the
  MSS USB for the USB OUT transfer. Once ready, the MSS USB will start this OUT
  transfer depending on the configuration of the OUT pipe on which this transfer
  is occurring. The USBH-MSC driver takes care of the allocation and
  configuration of the OUT pipe during enumeration process depending on the

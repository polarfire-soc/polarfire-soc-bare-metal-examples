**README**

**Description:**

This Python script is designed to send binary data over a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus using the Python `can` library. It reads binary data from a file and sends it over CAN in chunks, with error checking and flow control.

**Dependencies:**

- Python 3.x
- `can` library (`pip install python-can`)

**Usage:**

1. Ensure that the Python `can` library is installed (`pip install python-can`).
2. Connect your CAN interface hardware and configure it appropriately.
3. Replace `wic_file_path` variable with the path to your binary data file.
4. Optionally, adjust `can_channel`, `fixed_can_id`, and `delay_seconds` variables according to your CAN setup.
5. Run the script.

**Functions:**

- `init_can(channel)`: Initializes the CAN bus connection.
- `send_can_message(can_id, data, control_flow)`: Sends a CAN message with specified ID, data, and control flow flag.
- `read_data_from_file(file_path)`: Reads binary data from a file and calculates the file size.
- `send_data_from_wic_file(file_path, can_id, small_delay, block_size=512)`: Sends data from a binary file over CAN in chunks.
- `receive_messages(data_expected, timeout)`: Receives a single CAN message within a specified timeout.

**How to Run:**

1. Ensure your CAN interface is properly connected and configured.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
4. Run the script using the command: `python script_name.py`.

**Example:**

```bash
python can_data_transfer.py
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the CAN interface.

**Disclaimer:**

This script is provided as-is without any warranty. Use it at your own risk. Ensure that you understand the implications of sending data over a CAN bus, especially in safety-critical or production environments.

  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS System services Bare Metal Driver

  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire SoC system services are the services offered by the system
  controller. These services can be requested by PolarFire SoC MSS over System
  Controller Bus (SCB). The MSS appears as SCB master over the SCB bus. MSS can
  communicate with system controller over SCB by write/read to the MSS SCB
  register space. The PolarFire SoC system service driver software provides a
  set of functions for controlling the PolarFire SoC system services as part of
  a bare-metal system where no operating system is available. It can be adapted
  to be used as a part of an operating system, but the implementation of the
  adaptation layer between this driver and the operating system's driver model
  is outside the scope of this driver.

  ==============================================================================
  Hardware Flow Dependencies
  ==============================================================================
  The configuration of all the features of the PolarFire SoC MSS system services
  is covered by this driver. Besides, this driver does not require any other
  configuration. It relies on SCB register access interface to communicate with
  system controller.
  The base address and register addresses are defined in this driver as
  constants. The interrupt number assigned are defined as constants in the MPFS
  HAL. Ensure that the latest MPFS HAL is included in the project settings of
  the SoftConsole toolchain and that it is generated into your project.

  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire SoC system services are the services offered by the system
  controller. These services can be requested by PolarFire SoC MSS over System
  Controller Bus (SCB). The MSS appears as SCB master over the SCB bus. MSS can
  communicate with the system controller over SCB by accessing the MSS SCB
  register space. Requesting a system service over the SCB bus involves a
  command/response sequence to transfer a system service command from the MSS to
  the system controller and to transfer status back from the system controller
  to the MSS. The MSS SCB register space also provides access to the mailbox.
  The mailbox is used for passing data related to the system service between the
  MSS and system controller in both directions.
  On completion of service, the system controller also writes a status code
  indicating the successful completion of the system service or an error code
  into the status register.

  These system services are grouped into the following categories:
    -  Device and design information services
    -  Design services
    -  Data security services
    -  Fabric services
    -  MSS services

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Device and Design Information Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC system service driver can be used to read information about
  the device on which it is being executed and the current fabric design by
  making a call to the following functions.
    -  MSS_SYS_get_serial_number()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_user_code()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_design_info()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_device_certificate()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_digest()
    -  MSS_SYS_query_security()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_debug_info()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_envm_param()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Design Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC system service driver can be used to execute UIC script and
  perform bitstream authentication using the following functions.
    -  MSS_SYS_execute_UIC_script_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_UIC_bitstream_authenticate_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_bitstream_authenticate_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_IAP_image_authenticate_service()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Data Security Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute data security
  services using the following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_digital_signature_service ()
    -  MSS_SYS_secure_nvm_write()
    -  MSS_SYS_secure_nvm_read()
    -  MSS_SYS_puf_emulation_service ()
    -  MSS_SYS_nonce_service ()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Executing Fabric Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute fabric services
  using the following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_digest_check_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_iap_service()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MSS Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute MSS services
  using following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_spi_copy_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_probe_read_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_probe_write_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_live_probe_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_MEM_select_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_MEM_read_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_MEM_write_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_apb_read_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_apb_write_debug_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_snapshot_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_generate_otp_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_match_otp_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_unlock_debug_passcode_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_one_way_passcode_service()
    -  MSS_SYS_terminate_debug_service()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mode of operation and status response
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC MSS system service driver can be configured to execute
  service in interrupt mode or polling mode. User need to select the mode of
  operation by configuring the driver with appropriate service mode macros as a
  parameter to MSS_SYS_select_service_mode() function. For interrupt mode, the
  calling service function exits after requesting the system service with a
  success return value. The actual response from the system controller will only
  be available after the interrupt occurs. Use the MSS_SYS_read_response()
  function to read the service response and the status response code.
  For Polling mode, the calling service function exits only after the
  completion of the service, the return value in this case will indicate the
  service response code received from the system controller.
  All the service execution functions return the 16-bit status returned by
  system controller on executing the given service. A zero value indicates the
  successful execution of that service. A non-zero value indicates an error code
  representing the type of error that was encountered while executing the service.
  Irrespective of the mode, if the controller is busy executing the previous
  service the function will exit with the MSS_SYS_BUSY return value. The error
  codes are different for each service. See individual function descriptions to
  know the meaning of the error code for each service.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*//**
  The MSS_SYS_authenticate_iap_image() function is used to authenticate
  the IAP image which is located in SPI through a system service routine. The
  service checks the image descriptor and the referenced bitstream and optional
  initialization data.  If the image is authenticated successfully, then the
  image is guaranteed to be valid when used by an IAP function.

  This service is applicable to bitstreams stored in SPI Flash memory only.
  This function is non-blocking in the interrupt mode , in that, it will exit
  immediately after requesting the service. In polling mode, it becomes a
  blocking function. It will block until the the service is completed and a
  response is received from the system controller.

  @param spi_idx
                    The spi_idx parameter specifies the index in the SPI directory to
                    be used where the IAP bit-stream is stored.

                    Note: To support recovery SPI_IDX=1 should be an empty slot
                    and the recovery image should be located in SPI_IDX=0. Since
                    SPI_IDX=1 should be an empty slot it shouldn’t be passed into
                    the system service.
  @return
                   The MSS_SYS_authenticate_iap_image function returns
                   one of following status codes. The status code indicates
                   the success/failure status of the service execution.

                    contains the data read from sNVM region. User should
                    provide the buffer large enough to store the read data.
  @param data_len
                    The data_len parameter specifies the number of bytes to be
                    read from sNVM.
                    The application should know whether the data written in the
                    chose sNVM module was previously stored using Authentication
                    or not.
                    The data_len should be 236 bytes, for authenticated data,
                    for not authenticated data the data_len should be 252 bytes.
  @param mb_offset
                    The mb_offset parameter specifies the offset from the start
                    of mailbox where the data related to this service is
                    available. All accesses to the mailbox are of word length
                    (4 bytes). A value 10 (decimal) of this parameter would
                    mean that the data access area for this service, in the
                    mailbox starts from 11th word (offset 10).
  @return
                    This function returns a value to indicate whether the
                    service was executed successfully or not. A zero value
                    indicates that the service was executed successfully. A

  The MSS_SYS_execute_iap() function is used to IAP service. The IAP service
  allows the user to reprogram the device without the need for an external
  master. The user design writes the bitstream to be programmed into a SPI Flash
  connected to the SPI port.  When the service is invoked, the System Controller
  automatically reads the bitstream from the SPI flash and programs the device.
  The service allows the image to be executed in either VERIFY or PROGRAM modes.
  Another option for IAP is to perform the auto-update sequence. In this case
  the newest image of the first two images in the SPI directory is chosen to be
  programmed.
  This function is non-blocking in the interrupt mode , in that, it will exit
  immediately after requesting the service. In polling mode, it becomes a
  blocking function. It will block until the the service is completed and a
  response is received from the system controller.

                    lock states for supported MEMLOCKMODE values.
  @param timeout
                    When a lock is requested we must consider a scenario
                    where the user design may not complete the request
                    handshake.  To prevent the firmware from waiting

                    available. All accesses to the mailbox are of word length
                    (4 bytes). A value 10 (decimal) of this parameter would
                    mean that the data access area for this service, in the
                    mailbox starts from 11th word (offset 10).

  The MSS_SYS_debug_fabric_snapshot() function will service generates a
  snapshot of the volatile fabric content. Data is read from each LSRAM, µRAM
  and probe module and copied to the fabric APB debug port.
  This function is non-blocking in the interrupt mode , in that, it will exit
  immediately after requesting the service. In polling mode, it becomes a
  blocking function. It will block until the the service is completed and a
  response is received from the system controller.

                    mean that the data access area for this service, in the
                    mailbox starts from 11th word (offset 10).
  @return
                    This function returns a value to indicate whether the
                    service was executed successfully or not. A zero value
                    indicates that the service was executed successfully. A

                    (4 bytes). A value 10 (decimal) of this parameter would
                    mean that the data access area for this service, in the
                    mailbox starts from 11th word (offset 10).
  @param ret_offset
                    The ret_offset parameter specifies the offset from the
                    start of Mailbox response where the data received from
                    the service will be available.
  @return
                    This function returns a value to indicate whether the
                    service was executed successfully or not. A zero value
                    indicates that the service was executed successfully. A
                    non-zero value can indicate that either the driver was not
                    able to kick-start the service or that the driver was able
                    to kick-start the service and receive a status response code
                    from the system controller.

                    about the return status.

                  |         |            | PASSCODE_FAIL is generated.         |

  If any part of the service fails, then all unlocked passcodes are re-locked
  and the tamper event PASSCODE_FAIL is generated.

  The MSS_SYS_debug_terminate() function will terminate the debug
  session. Its purpose is to re-lock all the software based debug locks
  (SWL_DEBUG) if needed and to release any memories previously locked using
  the MEM Select Debug Service.
  This function is non-blocking in the interrupt mode , in that, it will exit
  immediately after requesting the service. In polling mode, it becomes a
  blocking function. It will block until the the service is completed and a
  response is received from the system controller.

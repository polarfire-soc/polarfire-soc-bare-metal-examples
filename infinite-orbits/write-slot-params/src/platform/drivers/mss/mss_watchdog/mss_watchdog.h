  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS Watchdog Bare Metal Driver

  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire SoC Microprocessor SubSystem (MSS) includes five instances of
  watchdog timer hardware blocks used to detect system lockups. This software
  driver provides a set of functions for controlling the MSS watchdog as part of
  a bare metal system where no operating system is available. The driver can be
  adapted for use as part of an operating system, but the implementation of the
  adaptation layer between the driver and the operating system's driver model is
  outside the scope of the driver.
  
  The MSS watchdog driver provides support for the following features:
    - Initialization of the MSS watchdog
    - Reading the current value and status of the watchdog timer
    - Refreshing the watchdog timer value
    - Enabling, disabling and clearing timeout and MVRP interrupts.
    
  ==============================================================================
  Hardware Flow Dependencies
  ==============================================================================
  The configuration of all the features of the PolarFire SoC MSS watchdog is
  covered by this driver. Besides, this driver does not require any other
  configuration.

  On PolarFire SoC an AXI switch forms a bus matrix interconnect among multiple
  masters and multiple slaves. Five RISC-V CPUs connect to the Master ports
  M10 to M14 of the AXI switch. By default, all the APB peripherals are
  accessible on AXI-Slave 5 of the AXI switch via the AXI to AHB and AHB to APB
  bridges (referred as main APB bus). However, to support logical separation in
  the Asymmetric Multi-Processing (AMP) mode of operation, the APB peripherals
  can alternatively be accessed on the AXI-Slave 6 via the AXI to AHB and AHB to
  APB bridges (referred as the AMP APB bus).

  Application must make sure that the desired MSS Watchdog instance is
  appropriately configured on one of the APB slaves described above by
  configuring the PolarFire SoC system registers (SYSREG) as per the application
  need and that the appropriate data structures are provided to this driver as
  parameter to the functions provided by this driver.

  The base address and register addresses are defined in this driver as
  constants. The interrupt number assignment for the MSS Watchdog peripherals
  are defined as constants in the MPFS HAL. You must ensure that the latest MPFS
  HAL is included in the project settings of the SoftConsole tool chain and that
  it is generated into your project.
  
  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The MSS watchdog driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization and configuration
    - Reading the current value and status of the watchdog timer
    - Refreshing the watchdog timer value
    - Support for enabling, disabling and clearing time-out and MVRP interrupts.
    
  --------------------------------
  Initialization and Configuration
  --------------------------------
  The MSS Watchdog driver provides the MSS_WD_configure() function to configure
  the MSS Watchdog with desired configuration values. It also provides the
  MSS_WD_get_config() function to read back the current configurations of the
  MSS Watchdog. You can use this function to retrieve the current configurations
  and then overwrite them with the application specific values, such as initial
  watchdog timer value, Maximum Value (up to which) Refresh (is) Permitted,
  watchdog time-out value, enable/disable forbidden region, enable/disable
  MVRP interrupt and interrupt type.

  The occurrence of a time out event before the system reset can be detected
  using the MSS_WD_timeout_occured() function. This function would typically be
  used at the start of the application to detect whether the application is
  starting as a result of a power-on reset or a watchdog reset. The time out
  event must be cleared through a call to function MSS_WD_clear_timeout_event()
  in order to allow the detection of subsequent time out events or
  differentiating between a RISC-V initiated system reset and watchdog reset.

  --------------------------------------------
  Reading the Watchdog Timer Value and Status
  --------------------------------------------
  MSS Watchdog is a down counter. A refresh forbidden window can be created by
  configuring the watchdog Maximum Value up to which Refresh is Permitted (MVRP).
  When the current value of the watchdog timer is greater than the MVRP value,
  refreshing the watchdog is forbidden. Attempting to refresh the watchdog timer
  in the forbidden window will assert a timeout interrupt. The
  MSS_WD_forbidden_status() function can be used to know whether the watchdog
  timer is in forbidden window or has crossed it. By default, the forbidden
  window is disabled. It can be enabled by providing an appropriate value as
  parameter to the MSS_WD_configure() function. When the forbidden window is
  disabled, any attempt to refresh the watchdog timer is ignored and the counter
  keeps on down counting.

  The current value of the watchdog timer can be read using the
  MSS_WD_current_value() function. This function can be called at any time.

  --------------------------------------------
  Refreshing the Watchdog Timer Value
  --------------------------------------------
  The watchdog timer value is refreshed using the MSS_WD_reload() function. The
  value reloaded into the watchdog timer down-counter is specified at the
  configuration time with an appropriate value as parameter to the
  MSS_WD_get_config() function.

  --------------------------------------------
  Interrupt Control
  --------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC MSS Watchdog generates two interrupts, The MVRP interrupt and
  the timeout interrupt.
  The MVRP interrupt is generated when the watchdog down-counter crosses the
  Maximum Value up to which Refresh is Permitted (MVRP). Following functions to
  control MVRP interrupt:
    - MSS_WD_enable_mvrp_irq
    - MSS_WD_disable_mvrp_irq
    - MSS_WD_clear_mvrp_irq

  The timeout interrupt is generated when the watchdog down-counter crosses the
  watchdog timeout value. The timeout value is a non-zero value and it can be
  set to a maximum of MSS_WDOG_TRIGGER_MAX. The non-maskable interrupt is
  generated when the watchdog crosses this timeout value, the down counter
  keeps on down counting and a reset signal is generated when reaches zero.
  Following functions to control timeout interrupt:
    - MSS_WD_enable_timeout_irq
    - MSS_WD_disable_timeout_irq
    - MSS_WD_clear_timeout_irq

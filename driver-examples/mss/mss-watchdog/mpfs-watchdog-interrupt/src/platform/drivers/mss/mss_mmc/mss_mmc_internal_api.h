  --------------------------------
  High Priority Interrupt
  --------------------------------
  The following functions are used for eMMC high priority interrupt operation:
    - MSS_MMC_pause_sdma_write_hpi()
    - MSS_MMC_resume_sdma_write_hpi()

  To stop ongoing multiple block write transfers to the eMMC device using the
  high priority interrupt, a call is made to the MSS_MMC_pause_sdma_write_hpi()
  function. 
  
  To resume previously interrupted multiple block transfer of eMMC device, 
  a call is made to the MSS_MMC_resume_sdma_write_hpi() function.

  --------------------------------
  Packed Commands
  --------------------------------
  The following functions are used for eMMC packed command read and write:
    - MSS_MMC_packed_read()
    - MSS_MMC_packed_write()
  
  To read several multiple blocks of data stored within the eMMC device using
  the packed group of read commands, a call is made to the MSS_MMC_packed_read()
  function, specifying the base address of the buffer holding the data of the
  packed command header block and the base address of buffer where the data 
  read from the eMMC device will be stored.

  To write several multiple blocks of data to the eMMC device using the packed
  group of write commands, a call is made to the MSS_MMC_packed_write() 
  function, specifying the base address of the buffer holding the data of the
  packed command header block and the base address of buffer containing the
  data blocks to be stored into the eMMC device.

  --------------------------------
  Command Queue
  --------------------------------
  The following functions are used for eMMC command queue single task operation:
    - MSS_MMC_cq_single_task_write()
    - MSS_MMC_cq_single_task_read()

  To write a single block or multiple blocks of data to the eMMC device using
  a command queue, a call is made to the MSS_MMC_cq_single_task_write()
  function. This function supports a single task only.

  To read a single block or multiple blocks of data stored within the eMMC
  device using a command queue, a call is made to the
  MSS_MMC_cq_single_task_read() function. This function supports a single task
  only.

  The MSS_MMC_pause_sdma_write_hpi() function is used to pause the ongoing SDMA
  write transfer using the eMMC high priority interrupt (HPI).

  Note: This MSS_MMC_pause_sdma_write_hpi()function has parameters provided
  purely for svg use case. if this function in production release then we
  should remove the need for parameters.

  @param src
  This parameter is a pointer to a buffer containing actual the data to be
  stored in the eMMC device. The src parameter must be identical to the src
  parameter of the MSS_MMC_sdma_write() function.

  @param dest
  This parameter specifies the sector address in the eMMC device where the block
  is to be stored. The dest parameter must be identical to the dest parameter of
  the MSS_MMC_sdma_write() function.

  @param size
  The parameter size specifies the size in bytes of the requested transfer.
  The size parameter must be identical to the size parameter of the 
  MSS_MMC_sdma_write() function.

  @return
  This function returns a value of type mss_mmc_status_t which specifies the
  transfer status of the operation.

  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS System services Bare Metal Driver

  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire SoC system services are the services offered by the system
  controller. These services can be requested by PolarFire SoC MSS over System
  Controller Bus (SCB). The MSS appears as SCB master over the SCB bus. MSS can
  communicate with system controller over SCB by write/read to the MSS SCB
  register space. The PolarFire SoC system service driver software provides a
  set of functions for controlling the PolarFire SoC system services as part of
  a bare-metal system where no operating system is available. It can be adapted
  to be used as a part of an operating system, but the implementation of the
  adaptation layer between this driver and the operating system's driver model
  is outside the scope of this driver.

  ==============================================================================
  Hardware Flow Dependencies
  ==============================================================================
  The configuration of all the features of the PolarFire SoC MSS system services
  is covered by this driver. Besides, this driver does not require any other
  configuration. It relies on SCB register access interface to communicate with
  system controller.
  The base address and register addresses are defined in this driver as
  constants. The interrupt number assigned are defined as constants in the MPFS
  HAL. Ensure that the latest MPFS HAL is included in the project settings of
  the SoftConsole toolchain and that it is generated into your project.

  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire SoC system services are the services offered by the system
  controller. These services can be requested by PolarFire SoC MSS over System
  Controller Bus (SCB). The MSS appears as SCB master over the SCB bus. MSS can
  communicate with the system controller over SCB by accessing the MSS SCB
  register space. Requesting a system service over the SCB bus involves a
  command/response sequence to transfer a system service command from the MSS to
  the system controller and to transfer status back from the system controller
  to the MSS. The MSS SCB register space also provides access to the mailbox.
  The mailbox is used for passing data related to the system service between the
  MSS and system controller in both directions.
  On completion of service, the system controller also writes a status code
  indicating the successful completion of the system service or an error code
  into the status register.

  These system services are grouped into the following categories:
    -  Device and design information services
    -  Design services
    -  Data security services
    -  Fabric services
    -  MSS services

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Device and Design Information Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC system service driver can be used to read information about
  the device on which it is being executed and the current fabric design by
  making a call to the following functions.
    -  MSS_SYS_get_serial_number()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_user_code()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_design_info()
    -  MSS_SYS_get_device_certificate()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_digest()
    -  MSS_SYS_query_security()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_debug_info()
    -  MSS_SYS_read_envm_parameter()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Design Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC system service driver can be used to perform bitstream
  authentication using the following functions.
    -  MSS_SYS_authenticate_bitstream()
    -  MSS_SYS_authenticate_iap_image()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Data Security Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute data security
  services using the following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_digital_signature_service ()
    -  MSS_SYS_secure_nvm_write()
    -  MSS_SYS_secure_nvm_read()
    -  MSS_SYS_puf_emulation_service ()
    -  MSS_SYS_nonce_service ()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Executing Fabric Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute fabric services
  using the following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_digest_check()
    -  MSS_SYS_execute_iap()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MSS Services
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC System Service driver can be used to execute MSS services
  using following functions:
    -  MSS_SYS_spi_copy()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_read_probe()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_write_probe()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_live_probe()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_select_mem()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_read_mem()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_write_mem()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_read_apb()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_write_apb()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_fabric_snapshot()
    -  MSS_SYS_otp_generate()
    -  MSS_SYS_otp_match()
    -  MSS_SYS_unlock_debug_passcode()
    -  MSS_SYS_one_way_passcode()
    -  MSS_SYS_debug_terminate()

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Modes of operation
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The PolarFire SoC MSS system service driver can be configured to execute
  service in interrupt mode or polling mode. Users need to select the mode of
  operation by configuring the driver with appropriate service mode macros as a
  parameter to MSS_SYS_select_service_mode() function.
  In interrupt mode, the function will be non-blocking and the calling service
  function exits after requesting the system service with a success return value.
  The actual response from the system controller will only be available after 
  the interrupt occurs. Use the MSS_SYS_read_response() function to read the 
  service response and the status response code.
  In Polling mode, the function call will be blocking until the service completes
  and the calling service function exits only after the completion of the service. 
  The return value in this case will indicate the service response code received 
  from the system controller.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Status response
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  All the service execution functions return the 16-bit status returned by
  system controller on executing the given service. A zero value indicates the
  successful execution of that service. A non-zero value indicates an error code
  representing the type of error that was encountered while executing the service.
  Irrespective of the mode, if the controller is busy executing the previous
  service the function will exit with the MSS_SYS_BUSY return value. The error
  codes are different for each service. See individual function descriptions to
  know the meaning of the error code for each service.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reference document
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The function descriptions in this file will mainly focus on details required
  by the user to use the APIs provided by this driver to execute the services.

                USBD driver

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The USB Device Driver (USBD) is part of USB-LL layer of the MSS USB driver
  stack. The USBD driver implements the core functionality of the USB device
  mode operations. The USBD driver is responsible for the following
  functionalities.
    •    USB Device Enumeration
    •    USB Standard request handling
    •    USB Suspend, Resume and Reset handling
    •    Endpoint management
    •    USB transfers management
    •    USBD-Class call-back interface
    •    Application call-back interface

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The following steps are involved in the operation of MSS USB:
    •    Configuration
    •    Initialization
    •    USBD-Class Interface
    •    Application Interface
    •    Data transfer
  The USBD driver operation depends on user configuration provided in
  mss_usb_config.h.

  Configuration
  The following parameter must be defined in the mss_usb_config.h file to
  operate the MSS USB block in the USB device mode.

    MSS_USB_PERIPHERAL_MODE      Configures the MSS USB driver stack to operate
                                in the USB device mode.

  Initialization
  The USBD driver must be initialized by calling the MSS_USBD_init()
  initialization function with a parameter to select Hi Speed (HS) mode or
  Full Speed (FS) mode. The USB enumeration process is handled internally by
  this driver. The application only needs to provide the required application
  specific information (descriptors) by using MSS_USBD_set_desc_cb_handler() and
  the MSS_USBD_set_class_cb_handler() functions to this driver.

  Note: The USB low speed operation in device mode is not supported by the
  MSS USB hardware block.

  USBD-Class Call-back Interface
  This driver encapsulates the generic USB protocol functionality from the USB
  class functionality. The USBD driver needs the USBD-Class driver to implement
  a set of call-back functions implementing the class specific functionality.
  This driver provides a data type mss_usbd_class_cb_t which must be
  implemented by the USBD-Class drivers. This data type is the collection of
  call-back functions which must be implemented by the USBD-Class driver.
  Implementing all the elements of this structure may not be necessary for a
  specific USB class. The USBD-Class driver must define a structure of type
  mss_usbd_class_cb_t and implement its required elements. The USBD-Class
  driver must pass a pointer to this structure to the USBD driver using the
  MSS_USBD_set_class_cb_handler() function.

  Application Call-back Interface
  The application is required to provide the device specific descriptors during
  enumeration process, namely; device descriptor, device Qualifier descriptor
  and strings descriptors.
  These functions are elements of data structure of type mss_usbd_user_descr_cb_t.
  This structure must be defined and all the required elements of this structure
  must be implemented in the user application source code. The pointer to this
  structure must be passed to the USBD driver using the
  MSS_USBD_set_desc_cb_handler() function.

  Data transfer
  The USB Device uses ‘Endpoints’ for data transfer. The transmit endpoint and
  receive endpoint need to be configured for their respective configuration
  parameters before using them for data transfer. The functions
  MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure() and MSS_USBD_rx_ep_configure() must be used to
  configure transmit endpoint and receive endpoint respectively.

  The application must use the  MSS_USBD_tx_ep_write() function to start data
  transmission on a transmit endpoint. This function prepares the driver to
  transmit data to the Host. However, actual transmission happens on receiving
  IN packet from the USB Host. This function is non-blocking. The USBD-Class
  driver will be informed of the data transfer completion by a call of its
  call-back function. Transfer errors are also communicated to the USB-Class
  driver by a call to its call-back function. Please refer the USBD-Class
  interface section above for more details.

  This driver must first be prepared for it this driver must first be prepared.
  To receive data from the USB Host. The application must use the
  MSS_USBD_rx_ep_read_prepare() function for this purpose. This function is
  non-blocking. The USBD-Class driver will be informed of the reception of data
  by a call to its call-back function. Receive errors are also communicated to
  the USB-Class driver by a call to its call-back function. Please refer the
  USBD-Class Interface section above for more details.

  The USBD driver supports Bulk transfers using the DMA inside MSS USB or without
  using the internal DMA.   It is advised that the USBD driver is configured to
  use the internal DMA in order to free up the application from transferring data
  to/from MSS USB hardware block. However, the internal DMA can access only
  aligned address. Care must  be taken that the buffer address provided to the
  USBD driver must be modulo-4. This is not a requirement when the MSS USB driver
  is configured not to use internal DMA.

  The functions MSS_USBD_tx_ep_stall() or MSS_USBD_rx_ep_stall() function must
  be used when the USBD-Class driver needs to stall a particular endpoint.
  The stall condition on an endpoint can be cleared using the
  MSS_USBD_tx_ep_clr_error() and MSS_USBD_rx_ep_clr_error() functions on
  respective endpoint. However, note that, different USB classes have different
  requirement for clearing the stall condition. E.g. MSC device class needs the
  stall to be cleared by the USB host rather than the firmware running on the
  MSC device.

  The control endpoint is significantly different in compared to a transmit
  endpoint or a receive endpoint. The control endpoint can be used for both
  transmitting data to the host or receiving data from the host. Separate
  functions are provided to configure and perform data transfers over control
  endpoint. The MSS_USBD_cep_configure() function must be used to configure the
  control endpoint. The function MSS_USBD_cep_write() and
  MSS_USBD_cep_read_prepare() must be used to transmit and receive data over
  control endpoint respectively.

  The stall condition on control endpoint is handled by the USBD driver
  internally because the control endpoint is shared by the USBD driver and the
  USBD-Class driver. The USBD-Class driver must provide meaningful return value
  in the call-back functions related to the control endpoint. The USBD driver
  will appropriately handle the stall condition on the control endpoint
  depending on these return values.

  will be called by the USBD driver on specific events on the USB bus.

  usbd_class_init
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_init element will be called when the USB
  device receives SET_CONFIGURATION request from USB host with a non-zero cfgidx
  number. The parameter cfgidx indicates the configuration number that must be
  set by the USB device. The USB device goes into the MSS_USB_CONFIGURED_STATE
  on receiving this command. The musb_speed parameter indicates the USB speed at
  which the MSS USB is operating. The speed of operation is determined during
  enumeration process.

  usbd_class_release
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_release element will be called when the
  USB device receives SET_CONFIGURATION request from USB host with a cfgidx = 0.
  The parameter cfgidx indicates the configuration number that must be set by
  the USB device. The USB device goes into the MSS_USB_ADDRESS_STATE on receiving
  this command. It will also be called when the device is disconnected from the
  host. The disconnect event is detected by the USBD driver and is communicated
  to the class driver using this element by passing the parameter cfgidf = 0xFF.
  On detecting the disconnect event, the USB device goes into the
  MSS_USB_NOT_ATTACHED_STATE state.

  usbd_class_get_descriptor
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_get_descriptor element will be called
  when the USB device receives GET_DESCRIPTOR request from the USB host
  requesting a class specific descriptor. The parameter recipient indicates the
  intended recipient by the USB host (endpoint, interface or device). The
  parameter type indicates the type of descriptor requested. The musb_speed
  parameter indicates the USB speed at which the MSS USB is operating. The speed
  of operation is determined during enumeration process. The musb_speed
  parameter must be used to provide speed dependent descriptors.

  usbd_class_process_request
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_process_request element will be called
  when the USB device receives class specific request from USB host. The
  parameter setup_pkt is the pointer to the setup packet sent by the host. The
  parameters buf_p and length are used for the data which might be associated
  with the current setup packet. If the host requests data from the device, the
  USBD-Class driver must provide the address of the buffer containing the data
  in buf_p parameter and the length of this buffer in bytes in length parameter.
  If the host wants to send data to the device then USBD-Class driver must
  provide the address of the buffer where the data must be placed in buf_p
  parameter and the size of the buffer in bytes in the length parameter. For the
  zero data length request the buf_p and the length parameters are not meaningful.

  usbd_class_tx_done
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_tx_done element will be called when the
  data is transferred on previously configured transmit endpoint. The endpoint
  on which data is transmitted is indicated by parameter num. The parameter
  status indicates the error status of the transmit transaction. A non-zero
  status value indicates that there was an error occurred in the last receive
  transaction.

  usbd_class_rx_done
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_rx_done element will be called when data
  is received on previously configured receive endpoint. The endpoint on which
  data is received is indicated by parameter num. The parameter status indicates
  the error status of the receive transaction. A non-zero status value indicates
  that there was an error occurred in the last receive transaction. The rx_count
  parameter indicates the number of bytes received in the last receive
  transaction.

  usbd_class_cep_tx_done
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_cep_tx_done element will be called when
  a data packet is transmitted on the previously configured control endpoint.
  The data buffer was provided to this driver using the usbd_class_process_request
  call-back before the usbd_class_cep_tx_done call-back was called. The parameter
  status indicates error status of the transmit transaction. A non-zero status
  value indicates that there was error in last transmit transaction.

  usbd_class_cep_rx_done
  The function pointed by the usbd_class_cep_rx_done element will be called when
  a data packet is received on previously configured control endpoint. The
  received data is stored in the buffer which was previously provided by the
  usbd_class_process_request call-back before usbd_class_cep_rx_done is called.
  The parameter status indicates the error status of the receive transaction.
  A non-zero status value indicates that there was an error occurred in the last
  receive transaction.

  @brief MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure()
    The MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure() function configures the transmit endpoint
    with the configuration values provided as parameters. After initializing the
    core, this function must be called before any other function for the desired
    transmit endpoint.

    Note:  This driver does not make any assumptions on the FIFO size and FIFO
    address, to provide complete flexibility in configuring the FIFOs. The user
    is responsible to make sure that the endpoint FIFO does not overlap with
    other endpoint FIFO space.


  @param ep_num
    The ep_num parameter is the endpoint number which is to be configured.
    The endpoint number must be of the type mss_usb_ep_num_t.

  @param fifo_addr
    The fifo_addr parameter is the address of the FIFO in the MSS_USB internal
    RAM. Valid FIFO address values are from 0x00 to 0xFFF8. The FIFO address
    must be a multiple of 8. If the value provided is not a multiple of 8, then
    the immediate lower value which is a multiple of 8 is taken as the FIFO
    address. E.g. If the provided value is 0x09, the actual value taken by the
    driver is 0x08. If the provided value is less than 0x08 then the FIFO
    address is taken as 0x00.

  @param fifo_size
    The fifo_size parameter is the endpoint FIFO size in the MSS USB core
    internal RAM. Valid FIFO size values are 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024,
    2048, 4096. The MSS USB core assigns 8 byte FIFO by default if the FIFO size
    is not configured.

  @param max_pkt_size
    The max_pkt_size parameter is the maximum packet size of the USB transfer
    on this endpoint. This value must be equal to the maximum packet size as
    mentioned in the endpoint descriptor for this endpoint which is used during
    enumeration process.

    Note: This value must be less than or equal to the FIFO size value.

  @param num_usb_pkt
    The num_usb_pkt parameter has different meanings for different types of
    transfers.

    Low bandwidth ISO/interrupt transfers – This parameter must always be ‘1u’.
    This parameter represents the number of packets transferred in one (micro)
    frame.

    High bandwidth ISO transfers – This parameter represents the number of
    packets transferred in one (Micro) frame. In this case, this parameter can
    have a value of 1, 2 or 3. High bandwidth ISO transfers are not yet implemented.

    Bulk transfers. – For Bulk transfer this value must always be ‘1u’. This
    parameter is used with the auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature where it
    indicates the number of bulk packets to be auto-amalgamated/auto-split in a
    bulk transfer. The auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature is not available yet.

  @param dma_enable
    The dma_enable parameter specifies whether or not the internal DMA must be
    used for the data transfer from the provided buffer to the USB FIFO.

  @param dma_channel
    The dma_channel parameter specifies the internal DMA channel to be used for
    the data transfers. The DMA channel will be associated with the selected
    endpoint. Unique DMA channel must be selected to transfer data on individual
    endpoints. This parameter is ignored when the dma_enable parameter indicates
    that the DMA must not be used.

  @param xfr_type
    The xfr_type parameter specifies the type of transfer to be performed on the
    selected endpoint. All other types of transfers (Interrupt, Isochronous, and
    Bulk) can be selected except control transfer.

   @param add_zlp
    The add_zlp parameter indicates whether a zero length packet (ZLP) must be
    sent if the transfer is an exact multiple of wMaxPacketSize. This parameter
    is only applicable for Bulk transfers. This parameter is ignored for all
    other transfer types.

  @return
    This function does not return a value.

  @brief MSS_USBD_get_dev_address()
    The MSS_USBD_get_dev_address() function is used to read the current USB
    address by which the host addresses this device. By default this address is
    0x00. This address gets updated during the enumeration process when the USB
    host assigns a non-zero address to this device using the SET_ADDRESS request.

  @param
    This function does not take any parameter.

  @return
    This function returns 8-bit value indicating the current USB address to which
    this device responds over USB.

  Example:
  @code
        MSS_USBD_get_dev_address();

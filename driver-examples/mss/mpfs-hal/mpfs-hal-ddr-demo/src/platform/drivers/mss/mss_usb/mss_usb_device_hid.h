  @mainpage PolarFire SoC MSS USB driver
                    USBD-HID class driver

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The Human Interface Device class driver implements the USB HID class
  functionality specified by the USB-IF. This driver supports the HID mouse
  functionality. The USB control transfers and Interrupt transfers are used to
  implement this functionality. With this driver, the PolarFire SoC device
  appears as a Human interface class Mouse device when connected to USB host,
  This driver can be extended to be used for other HID class functionalities.

  This driver uses the USBD-Class driver template to implement the HID class
  functionality.

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The following steps are involved in the operation of the USBD-HID driver:
    -   Configuration
    -   Initialization
    -   Enumeration
    -   Class Specific requests
    -   data transfer
  Configuration
  The MSS USB driver stack must first be configured in the USB device mode using
  the MSS_USB_PERIPHERAL_MODE constant to use this driver. No other
  configuration is necessary.

Initialization
  The HID class driver must be initialized using the MSS_USBD_HID_init() function.
  Once initialized, this driver will get configured by the USBD driver during
  the enumeration process. The call-back function usbd_hid_init_cb() is
  implemented by this driver which will be called by the USBD driver when the
  host configures this device. The USBD_HID_get_descriptor() function is
  implemented to provide class specific descriptor table to the USBD driver.

  This driver defines descriptor table which contains a configuration descriptor,
  an Interface descriptor, a HID class descriptor and an Interrupt IN endpoint
  descriptor for successful enumeration as a HID class device.

  Note: For successful enumeration, device specific descriptors must be provided
  by application using MSS_USBD_set_desc_cb_handler() function to the
  USBD driver. Since device, string descriptors etc. are not specific to a USB
  class they are not part of HID Class driver.

  Class Specific requests
  The requests specific to HID Class are handled internally by this driver. The
  call-back function usbd_hid_process_request_cb(), is implemented by this
  driver which processes the HID class specific requests.

  Data transfer
  This driver only needs to perform the USB IN transfers on the Interrupt
  endpoint. The period at which this transfer is repeated is defined by the
  endpoint descriptor during enumeration process. The application must use the
  MSS_USBD_HID_tx_report() function to provide the report to be transmitted.
  The application can use the MSS_USBD_HID_tx_done() function to know if the
  previously provided report is transmitted over USB. This driver implements
  the usbd_hid_tx_complete_cb()  function which will be called by the USBD
  driver when the data transfers is complete.

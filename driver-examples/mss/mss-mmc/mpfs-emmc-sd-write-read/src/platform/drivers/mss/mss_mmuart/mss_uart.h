  @mainpage PolarFire® SoC MSS UART Bare Metal Driver.

  ==============================================================================
  Introduction
  ==============================================================================
  The PolarFire® SoC Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) includes five multi-mode 
  UART(MMUART) peripherals for serial communication. This driver provides a set
  of functions to control the MSS MMUARTs as part of a bare metal system
  where no operating system is available. These drivers can be adapted for use
  as part of an operating system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer
  between this driver and the operating system's driver model is outside the
  scope of this driver.
  Note: MSS UART and MSS MMUART are synonymous in this document.

  ==============================================================================
  Hardware Flow Dependencies
  ==============================================================================
  The configuration of all features of the MSS MMUART peripherals is covered by
  this driver with the exception of the PolarFire® SoC IOMUX configuration.
  PolarFire® SoC allows multiple non-concurrent uses of external pins
  through IOMUX configuration. This feature allows optimization of external pin
  usage by assigning external pins for use by either the microprocessor
  subsystem or the FPGA fabric. The MSS MMUART serial signals are routed through
  IOMUXs to the PolarFire® SoC device external pins. The MSS MMUART serial
  signals may also be routed through IOMUXs to the PolarFire® SoC FPGA fabric.
  For more information on IOMUX, see the I/O Configuration section of the
  PolarFire® SoC Microprocessor Subsystem (MSS) User's Guide.

  The IOMUXs are configured using the PolarFire® SoC MSS configurator tool. You
  must ensure that the MSS MMUART peripherals are enabled and configured in the
  PolarFire® SoC MSS configurator if you wish to use them. For more information
  on IOMUXs, see the IOMUX section of the PolarFire® SoC Microprocessor
  Subsystem (MSS) User's Guide.

  On PolarFire® SoC, an AXI switch forms a bus matrix interconnect among 
  multiple masters and multiple slaves. Five RISC-V CPUs connect to the Master 
  ports M10 to M14 of the AXI switch. By default, all the APB peripherals are
  accessible on AXI-Slave 5 of the AXI switch using the AXI to AHB and AHB to APB
  bridges (referred as main APB bus). However, to support logical separation in
  the Asymmetric Multi-Processing (AMP) mode of operation, the APB peripherals
  can alternatively be accessed on the AXI-Slave 6 using the AXI to AHB and AHB to
  APB bridges (referred as the AMP APB bus).

  Application must make sure that the desired MMUART instance is appropriately
  configured on one of the APB bus as described above by configuring the 
  PolarFire® SoC system registers (SYSREG) as per the application need and that 
  the appropriate data structures are provided to this driver as parameter to 
  the functions provided by this driver.

  The base address and register addresses are defined in this driver as
  constants. The interrupt number assignment for the MSS MMUART peripherals are
  defined as constants in the MPFS HAL. You must ensure that the latest MPFS HAL
  is included in the project settings of the SoftConsole tool chain and that it
  is generated into your project.

  ==============================================================================
  Theory of Operation
  ==============================================================================
  The MSS MMUART driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization and configuration functions
    - Polled transmit and receive functions
    - Interrupt driven transmit and receive functions

  --------------------------------
  Initialization and Configuration
  --------------------------------
  The MSS MMUART supports the following four broad modes of operation:
    - UART or USART mode
    - LIN mode
    - IrDA mode
    - Smartcard or ISO 7816 mode

  The MSS MMUART driver provides the MSS_UART_init(), MSS_UART_lin_init(),
  MSS_UART_irda_init(), and MSS_UART_smartcard_init() functions to initialize the
  MSS MMUARTs for operation in one of these modes. One of these initialization
  functions must be called before calling any other MSS MMUART driver functions.
  The MSS MMUART operating modes are mutually exclusive; therefore, 
  only one of the initialization functions can be called. The first parameter of 
  the initialization functions is a pointer to one of ten global data structures
  used to store state information for each MSS MMUART. A pointer to these data
  structures is also used as the first parameter to many of the driver functions
  to identify which MSS MMUART is used by the called function. The names of
  these data structures are:
    - g_mss_uart0_lo
    - g_mss_uart1_lo
    - g_mss_uart2_lo
    - g_mss_uart3_lo
    - g_mss_uart4_lo
    - g_mss_uart0_hi
    - g_mss_uart1_hi
    - g_mss_uart2_hi
    - g_mss_uart3_hi
    - g_mss_uart4_hi

  Therefore, any call to an MSS MMUART function should be of the form
  MSS_UART_function_name( &g_mss_uart0_lo, ... ) or
  MSS_UART_function_name( &g_mss_uart1_hi, ... ).

  UART or USART Mode    
  For the UART or USART modes of operation, call the MSS_UART_init() function to
  initialize the MSS MMUART instance. This function takes the UART's
  configuration as its parameters. The MSS_UART_init() function must be called
  before calling any other MSS MMUART driver functions.
  The MSS_UART_init() function configures the baud rate based on the input baud
  rate parameter and, if possible, uses a fractional baud rate for greater
  precision. This function disables the LIN, IrDA, and SmartCard modes.

  LIN Mode    
  For the LIN mode of operation, call the MSS_UART_lin_init() function to
  initialize the MSS MMUART instance. This function takes the LIN node's
  configuration as its parameters. The MSS_UART_lin_init() function must be
  called before calling any other MSS MMUART driver functions. The
  MSS_UART_lin_init() function configures the baud rate based on the input baud
  rate parameter and, if possible, uses a fractional baud rate for greater
  precision. This function disables the IrDA and SmartCard modes.
  The driver also provides the following LIN mode configuration functions:
    - MSS_UART_set_break()
    - MSS_UART_clear_break()
    - MSS_UART_set_pidpei_handler()
    - MSS_UART_set_linbreak_handler()
    - MSS_UART_set_linsync_handler()

  Note: These LIN mode configuration functions can only be called after calling 
  the MSS_UART_lin_init() function.

  IrDA Mode    
  For the IrDA mode of operation, call the MSS_UART_irda_init() function to
  initialize the MSS MMUART instance. This function takes the IrDA node's
  configuration as its parameters. The MSS_UART_irda_init() function must be
  called before calling any other MSS MMUART driver functions. The
  MSS_UART_irda_init() function configures the baud rate based on the input baud
  rate parameter and, if possible, uses a fractional baud rate for greater
  precision. This function disables the LIN and SmartCard modes.

  Smartcard or ISO 7816 Mode    
  For the Smartcard or ISO 7816 mode of operation, call the
  MSS_UART_smartcard_init() function to initialize the MSS MMUART instance. This
  function takes the smartcard configuration as its parameters. The
  MSS_UART_smartcard_init() function must be called before calling any other
  MSS MMUART driver functions. The MSS_UART_smartcard_init() function configures
  the baud rate based on the input baud rate parameter and, if possible, uses a
  fractional baud rate for greater precision. This function disables the LIN and
  IrDA modes. The driver also provides the following Smartcard mode
  configuration functions:
    - MSS_UART_enable_halfduplex()
    - MSS_UART_disable_halfduplex()
    - MSS_UART_set_nack_handler()

  Note: These Smartcard mode configuration functions can only be called after
  calling the MSS_UART_smartcard_init() function.

  Common Configuration Functions    
  The driver also provides the configuration functions that can be used with all
  MSS MMUART operating modes. These common configuration functions are as
  follows:
    - MSS_UART_set_rx_endian()
    - MSS_UART_set_tx_endian()
    - MSS_UART_enable_afclear()
    - MSS_UART_disable_afclear()
    - MSS_UART_enable_rx_timeout()
    - MSS_UART_disable_rx_timeout()
    - MSS_UART_enable_tx_time_guard()
    - MSS_UART_disable_tx_time_guard()
    - MSS_UART_set_address()
    - MSS_UART_set_ready_mode()
    - MSS_UART_set_usart_mode()
    - MSS_UART_set_filter_length()
    - MSS_UART_enable_afm()
    - MSS_UART_disable_afm()

  Note: These configuration functions can only be called after calling one of
        the MSS_UART_init(), MSS_UART_lin_init(), MSS_UART_irda_init(), or
        MSS_UART_smartcard_init() function.

  --------------------------------------
  Polled Transmit and Receive Operations
  --------------------------------------
  The driver can be used to transmit and receive data once initialized.    
  Data is transmitted using the MSS_UART_polled_tx() function. This function is
  blocking, which means that it will only return once the data passed to the
  function has been sent to the MSS MMUART hardware transmitter. Data received
  by the MSS MMUART hardware receiver can be read by the MSS_UART_get_rx()
  function.    
  The MSS_UART_polled_tx_string() function is provided to transmit a NUL ('\0')
  terminated string in polled mode. This function is blocking, which means that
  it will only return once the data passed to the function has been sent to the
  MSS MMUART hardware transmitter.    
  The MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function fills the MSS MMUART hardware transmit
  FIFO with data from a buffer passed as a parameter and returns the number of
  bytes transferred to the FIFO. If the transmit FIFO is not empty when the
  MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function is called, it returns immediately without
  transferring any data to the FIFO.

  ---------------------------
  Interrupt Driven Operations
  ---------------------------
  The driver can also transmit or receive data under interrupt control, which
  frees your application to perform other tasks until an interrupt occurs,
  which indicates that the driver's attention is required.

  Local or PLIC Interrupt    
  PolarFire® SoC architecture provides flexibility in terms of how the MMUART
  interrupt is seen by the PolarFire® SoC Core Complex. Each of the five MMUART
  instance interrupt lines is connected to the PolarFire® SoC Core Complex PLIC.
  The MMUART0 instance interrupt line is also available as local interrupt on
  E51 processor. The MMUART1 instance interrupt onwards are available as local
  interrupt on the U54_1 processor onwards. For example MMUART2 interrupt is
  available as local interrupt on U54_2 and so on.

  Interrupt Handlers    
  The MSS MMUART driver supports all types of interrupt triggered by the MSS
  MMUART. The driver's internal top level interrupt handler identifies the
  source of the MSS MMUART interrupt and calls the corresponding lower level
  handler function that you previously registered with the driver through calls
  to the MSS_UART_set_rx_handler(), MSS_UART_set_tx_handler(),
  MSS_UART_set_rxstatus_handler(), and MSS_UART_set_modemstatus_handler()
  functions. You are responsible for creating these lower level interrupt
  handlers as part of your application and registering them with the
  driver.    
  Note: The PolarFire® SoC HAL defines the interrupt handler functions for all
        five MMUART instances (with weak linkage) and assigns them as the
        interrupt service routines (ISR) for the MSS MMUART interrupt inputs to
        the PolarFire® SoC Core Complex PLIC or the Local interrupts on each of
        the respective CPUs. The MSS MMUART driver provides the implementation
        functions to all these ISRs from which it calls its own internal top
        level, interrupt handler function.

  The MSS_UART_enable_irq() and MSS_UART_disable_irq() functions are used to
  enable or disable the received line status, received data available/character
  time-out, transmit holding register empty, and modem status interrupts at the
  MSS MMUART level.

  Note: MSS_UART_enable_irq(), MSS_UART_disable_irq(), and all the
  calls to set the handler functions assume that the MMUART interrupt is
  connected to the PolarFire® SoC Core Complex PLIC. If you want the MMUART
  interrupt to appear as a local interrupt to the corresponding hart then you
  must explicitly call the MSS_UART_enable_local_irq() function. This function
  disables the PLIC interrupt (if it was previously enable) and enable the
  local interrupt on the hart on which this function is being executed.

  Transmitting Data    
  Interrupt-driven transmit is initiated by calling MSS_UART_irq_tx(),
  that specifies the block of data to transmit. Your application is then free to
  perform other tasks and inquire later whether transmit is complete by
  calling the MSS_UART_tx_complete() function. The MSS_UART_irq_tx() function
  enables the UART's transmit holding register empty (THRE) interrupt and then,
  when the interrupt goes active, the driver's THRE interrupt handler
  transfers the data block to the UART until the entire block is transmitted.    
  Note: You can use the MSS_UART_set_tx_handler() function to assign an
        alternative handler to the THRE interrupt. In this case, your 
        alternative THRE interrupt handler must call MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo()
        to transfer the data to the UART.

  Receiving Data    
  Interrupt-driven receive is performed by first calling
  MSS_UART_set_rx_handler() to register a receive handler function that is
  called by the driver whenever receive data is available. You must provide this
  receive handler function which must call the MSS_UART_get_rx()
  function to actually read the received data.

  -----------
  UART Status
  -----------
  The function MSS_UART_get_rx_status() reads the receiver error
  status. This function returns the overrun, parity, framing, break, and FIFO
  error status of the receiver.    
  The function MSS_UART_get_tx_status() reads the transmitter status.
  This function returns the transmit empty (TEMT) and transmit holding register
  empty (THRE) status of the transmitter.    
  The function MSS_UART_get_modem_status() reads the modem status
  flags. This function returns the current value of the modem status register.

  --------
  Loopback
  --------
  The MSS_UART_set_loopback() function is used to locally loopback the Tx
  and Rx lines of a UART. This is not to be confused with the loopback of UART0
  to UART1, which can be achieved through the microprocessor subsystem's system
  registers.

  The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads the content of the UART receiver's FIFO

  parameter. The MSS_UART_get_rx() function returns the number of bytes copied

  immediately if no data is received.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads and accumulates the receiver
  status of the MSS UART instance before reading each byte from the receiver's
  data register/FIFO. This allows the driver to maintain a sticky record of any
  receiver errors that occur as the UART receives each data byte; receiver
  errors would otherwise be lost after each read from the receiver's data
  register. Calling the MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function returns any receiver

  The MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function returns the receiver error status of the

  Note:     The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads and accumulates the receiver

  receiver error status, which persists after the MSS_UART_get_rx() function
  returns. The MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function clears the driver's sticky

  Note:     The driver's transmit functions also read the line status
  register (LSR) as part of their implementation. When the driver reads the
  LSR, the UART clears any active receiver error bits in the LSR. This could
  result in the driver losing receiver errors. To avoid any loss of receiver

  configured. See the following details for the MODE0 and MODE1 description.
  
  @param this_uart
    The this_uart parameter is a pointer to an mss_uart_instance_t
    structure that identifies the MSS UART hardware block performing
    the requested function. There are ten such data structures. The data
    structures from g_mss_uart0_lo to g_mss_uart4_lo are associated with 
    MSS UART0 to MSS UART4 when they are connected on the AXI switch slave 5
    (main APB bus). The data structures g_mss_uart0_hi to g_mss_uart4_hi are
    associated with MSS UART0 to MSS UART4 when they are connected on the AXI
    switch slave 6 (AMP APB bus). This parameter must point to one of these ten
    global data structure defined within the UART driver.    
    Note: If you are using the UART on the AMP APB bus, the hardware
    configuration to connect UART on AMP APB bus must already be done by the
    application using SYSREG registers before initializing the UART instance
    structure.

  @param mode
    The mode parameter is the mss_uart_ready_mode_t type which is used to
    configure the TXRDY and RXRDY signal modes.    
    MODE0: RXRDY goes high (active) when there is at least one character
    in the RX FIFO (that is, the RDA is triggered when there is at least one
    character in the RX FIFO). TXRDY goes inactive after the first character is
    loaded in the Tx FIFO.    
    MODE1: RXRDY goes high (active) when the trigger level or the timeout is
    reached. TXRDY goes inactive when the Tx FIFO is completely full.

  @return
    This function does not return a value.

/***************************************************************************//**
  The MSS_UART_enable_local_irq() function enables the MMUART
  interrupt as a local interrupt to the hart rather than as a PLIC interrupt.
  MMUART interrupt can be configured to trigger a PLIC interrupt or it
  can be configured to trigger a local interrupt. The arrangement is such that
  the UART0 interrupt can appear as local interrupt on E51. The UART1 to UART4
  interrupts can appear as local interrupt to U51_1 to U54_4, respectively.
  The UART0 to UART4 can appear as PLIC interrupt. Multiple harts can enable
  and receive the PLIC interrupt, the hart that claims the interrupt processes
  it. For rest of the harts, the IRQ gets silently skipped as the interrupt
  claim has already been taken.    
  To enable the local interrupt, application must explicitly call
  MSS_UART_enable_local_irq() function. Note that this function disables the
  interrupt over PLIC if it was previously enabled.    
  This function must be called after the MMUART is initialized, the required
  interrupt handler functions are set and before initiating any data transfers.
  If you want to register multiple interrupt handlers such as Tx handler, rx
  handler and so on, then this function must be called after all such handlers
  are set.    
  Call to this function is treated as one time activity. The driver gives no
  option to disable the local interrupt and enable the PLIC interrupt again at
  runtime.
